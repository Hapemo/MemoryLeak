   "Relic Type": "Cordelia Flower",
   "Description": "Before the meaning of the Cordelia flower came to be, only a small portion of them were ever sighted. Such a unique flower caught the eye of a pair of close-knitted siblings, who would often shower it with melodies and tunes stemming from the depths of their heart. On rare occasions did tragic hymns reach these flowers, breathing new life within them as the fields flourished around the siblings. When tragedy befell upon these siblings, the Cordelia flower was finally in full bloom, representing both the hopes and regrets that still lingered within the once peaceful village."
