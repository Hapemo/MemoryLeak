   "Relic Type": "Ring",
   "Description": "Beneath the sea lies many fragments born from the sentimental feelings of those who dwell within, one of which belonged to a fisherman who once travelled across the roaring tides. Countless were the people he met, yet none could ever beat the ethereal figure his gaze settled on unconsciously. Captivated by her ravishing looks and amiable personality, thus began his new journey. Endless small talks eventually led to the exchange of rings between them, each containing the promise they made to each other. \"Take me with you on your journey when all is settled. I really wish to meet your little sibling too.\" Alas, the violent nature of the raging storm spares no one. Holding on for dear life, the ring that was once reinforced on his finger slid away, sinking down to the seabed, bringing along the memories and oaths it once carried. Despite the passing eons, she who bore the news of the passing of her lover continued to await his return again."
