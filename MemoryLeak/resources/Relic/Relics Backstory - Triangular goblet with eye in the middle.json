   "Description": "Seen as a blessing from above, the gift of foresight was highly sought after. Amidst the people was one by the name of Prometheus, whose forte included predicting the weather and crafting precise plans for the people onboard with him. High praise and worship bestowed upon him who promised peace and stability to the people. However, unbeknownst to the others were the curses that came hand in hand with the blessings he experienced. Fear gripped his mind as countless gruesome imageries conjured for the entirety of his life. Upon his passing, a goblet was found ashore, in which an eye was found plastered in the middle, reflecting immense terror of the beholder. "
