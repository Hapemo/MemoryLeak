   "Relic Type": "Timepiece",
   "Description": "With many uncertainties surrounding around life and death, a timepiece served not only as an indicator of time, but also assured the hearts of the people eventually. Such was the case with the fishermen that once travelled the distance seas together. Far and wide were the seas that lied ahead of them, yet the only form of assurance lies within the old vintage timepiece, ticking endlessly through the ages. It's said that the treasured timepiece was once invented by the renowned timekeeper between the people, whose intricate designs sparked the hearts of many, including the duo who used to visit his home regularly, bringing along with them a trinket or two in exchange for such valuable timepieces. Eventually, the disastrous nature of the great tsunami washed away everything in sight, bringing the lively ticking surrounding the rooms to come to an end."
