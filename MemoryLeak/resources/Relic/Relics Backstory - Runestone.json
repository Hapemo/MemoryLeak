   "Relic Type": "Runestone",
   "Description": "Within these small and compact runestones encompass the numerous fates of those who wander within the boundaries of life, each containing distinct stories of their own. A powerful wizard once resided among the people, whose antics often repelled those in search for their own destiny. \"Fear clings onto such fragile mortals who know not when their lives would reach an end.\" She would often muse to herself. As countless seasons passed, the melancholic wizard sits in silence as she looks at the ever-cracking runestone in her hands. The inevitability of one's fate remains unchanging for eternity, that, she finally understood."
